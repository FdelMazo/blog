  <p class="lead">
    I feel like I should have a blog. Specifically, a tech blog. Everything points towards it! I
    like coding, I like reading, I particularly like reading <em>blog posts</em>. So then, why don't
    I have one?!
  </p>

  <aside>

      <sup>1</sup>
      If by any chance you get an idea of my reading tastes and have a book in mind that I'll like,
      <a href="https://github.com/FdelMazo/blog/issues/1/#new_comment_field" target="_blank">let me know!</a>
    </p>


    <p>
      <sup>2</sup>
      I know I'm doing a huge disservice to this people with this quick and done summaries of their lives and
      contributions, but just bear with me while I try to make my case.

      Marco Rogers has some really good <a href="https://twitter.com/polotek/status/1351297231916187648"
        target="_blank">thoughts</a> on this topic.
    </p>
  </aside>

  <p>
    This past summer I bought and read exactly three books:
    <em>
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24091886-raw-thought-raw-nerve" target="_blank">
        Raw Thought, Raw Nerve</a>
    </em>
    by Aaron Swartz,
    <em>
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134825.The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar" target="_blank">
        The Cathedral & the Bazaar</a>
    </em>
    by Eric S. Raymond, and
    <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53011383-unix" target="_blank">
        UNIX: A History and a Memoir</a></em>
    by Brian Kernighan<sup>1</sup>.

    One is a recollection of past blog posts written by one of the most influential programmers and internet activists
    of this century, another one is a collection of essays by an authority on written hackerdom history, and the last
    one is a memoir by a CS legend whose most important contributions include books considered the state of
    the art on techcnical writing<sup>2</sup>.
  </p>

  <p>
    What do they all have in common? An emphasis on the written word. And not only that: this very same people strongly
    encourage the written word. On Eric S. Raymond's <em><a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#style"
        target="_blank"> How To Become A Hacker</a></em> he suggests that a good programmer should learn to write well.
    On his blog, Aaron Swartz <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/about" target="_blank">explains</a> how writing
    things down will help him reflect better on his thoughts. Heck, even BWK's talks<sup>3</sup> about how taking
    writing seriously will get you a long way. My point is... there is a clear connection between CS and the written
    word.
  </p>

  <p>
    So where is my blog? Nowadays it seems like every other kid in town has one. And don't get me wrong, I swear I
    want one! I have side projects of which I'm proud of, I do encounter bugs that feel like they deserve a post
    dedicated to them, and I do feel like I have a hot take on the latest blockchain news.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, we've already established that I'm a good <em>recipe</em> for a blog person, and I would love to
    follow the steps of my idols... so, <b>why don't I have a blog?</b>
  </p>

  <h2>I don't have anything interesting to say</h2>

  <p>
    First things first: I don't have anything interesting to say. Or, more specifically, even if I do have stuff to say,
    what I don't have is stuff to <em>add</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It feels as if I should have great things to say about... stuff... and yet I don't. Every opinion I have is a copy
    of a copy of a copy of the first 5 top-level comments on a reddit-slash-hacker-news comment section. Just
    regurgitating those thoughts on a centralized blog post would be pointless (why not just link to the original thread
    and let people make their own mind?).
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, let's say I did have a strong, unique, novel opinion on something and that I'll gladly write it down somewhere.
    But then... isn't that just Twitter? I dont have Twitter for a reason: nobody cares about my thoughts. So, why would
    they care about my longer-than-140-characters thoughts? I'm not trying to say that a blog and social media are the
    exact same medium, but in the end... it's just me, talking about myself.
  </p>

  <h2>I'm not a good programmer</h2>

  <p>
    Whenever I try to search for a how-to online, or I need to do a quick "Hello, World!", I often find myself skipping
    the first 5~10 search results. They are your tipical run-of-the-mill tutorials that replicate what's written on the
    official framework/language guide<sup>4</sup>. At least to me, this content just end up adding noise to the
    internet. And that's the last thing I would like to do! I love the internet! Adding unneccesary stuff to it is
    exactly what I want to avoid!
  </p>

  <p>
    To be entirely fair, most of my skills are no more than on the begginer level on X language. My struggles with
    Python are the same struggles anyone else had with Python (mutable defaults), and my struggles with Node.js are the
    ones that you solve clicking on the correct StackOverflow link. If I were to blog about my experiences on React, it
    would be exactly the same as everybody else's (i.e, an article that teaches on how to use `useState()` with a number
    counting component). I don't have a specific framework on which I'm savvy enough to talk about the internals of. I
    don't have any particularly good war stories (the ones that are really useful on those "What's the weirdest bug you
    ever encountered?" programming interviews). I get that sometimes an impostor syndrome is that, a person
    doubting themselves and feeling like a fraud. But sometimes, you are not an impostor (nor a fraud), you just are.
  </p>

  <h2>I don't think it's good CV building</h2>

  <p>
    Or maybe I do think it's good CV building, but I just can't accept it. I tend to feel (though not accept) that
    nowadays just <em>doing</em> is not enough. Nowadays it seems that you have to both do, and talk about what you just
    did. Build a whole narrative around it. You have to code a new feature, and then talk about it in your latest 1:1
    with your manager. And don't forget to write how you are proud of it in your perfomance review, or it doesn't count.
    If you just build it, maybe no one will come. Sometimes talk is not cheap, and showing the code is not enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I'm tired of that! Not all tech side-projects have a cute origin story, and not everything built should have a
    post accompanying it. Even though something may seem technically cute, there might be not so much to talk around it.
    Not all code speaks for itself, but making a circus around it shouldn't be the solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>In conclusion</b>, I think the gist of it is... blogging is clearly made for people who like writing and/or
    sharing. And I think it's okay if I'm not particular fond of any those two things. I shouldn't succumb to the peer
    pressure of thinking that everybody but me has a blog. So, if I were to have a blog, the motivation should be noble
    and straightforward: "I like to write and share my experiences".
  </p>

  <p>
    Until then, there's no blog for me.
